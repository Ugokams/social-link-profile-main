- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learnt how to use base-style on my css design. This is a new concept I saw while reviewing a peer's work on a previous task and felt the urge to try it out.


```css
:root {
  --green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --gray-700: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
  --gray-800: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  --gray-900: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  --gray-999: hsl(0, 0%, 1%);
}

p {
  font-size: var(--font-size-base);
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-regular);
  color: var(--gray-700);
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue working on my mobile first dsign and also refine the usage of base-style in css.
